 * of waiting on the ~10ms watchdog (which lets the CPU-port queue congest and

 * because the shipped stock kernel leaves it masked - see the R2 block below.
 * The refill-lag storm the original code feared is avoided because napi masks
 * the source while polling and re-checks for pending work on complete.
 *
 * ---- R2: MBUF_DESC_RUNOUT_IE (bit16) is now OFF by default -------------------
 * The SHIPPED STOCK KERNEL writes CPUIIMR = 0x807E31FE (decoded from stock
 * vmlinux 0x80192bb0: `lui v1,0x807e; addiu v1,v1,12798; sw v1,0x28(v0)`), i.e.
 *   LINK_CHANGE | PKTHDR_DESC_RUNOUT_ALL | RX_DONE_ALL | TX_ALL_DONE_ALL
 * — PKTHDR runout IS armed, but bit16 MBUF_DESC_RUNOUT is NOT. Ours was
 * 0x007F31FE: bit16 set (and LINK_CHANGE deliberately clear, see above).
 *
 * The comment above cited the public SDK (asicCom.c:1417) for arming "them"
 * (both runout sources). ★ This is the SAME SDK-vs-shipped-stock discrepancy
 * class as the DMA_CR0 water marks in rtl865x_start(), where the SDK says
 * 0xA0A0 and the shipped stock kernel says 0xA0CE — and that one turned out to
 * be directly implicated in this very wedge. The shipped kernel is ground truth.
 *
 * Mechanism this is suspected to fix (R2 = stop the large-frame CPU-RX wedge at
 * source rather than self-healing it): the wedge is an RX-FIFO drain-lag race
 * under CPU saturation, where descriptor writeback overtakes the multi-burst
 * payload DMA. MBUF runout asserts exactly during that saturation window, and if
 * MBUF_DESC_RUNOUT_IP is a level bit that write-1-ack cannot clear until the
 * buffer pool actually refills, arming it produces precisely the re-fire ->
 * IRQ-livelock -> wedge pattern this driver already documents for LINK_CHANGE_IE
 * two paragraphs up. Dropping bit16 keeps M6.3b's prompt-napi kick (PKTHDR
 * runout, which stock DOES arm and which covers the descriptor ring) while no
 * longer arming the one source stock leaves masked.
 *
 * ⚠ HYPOTHESIS, NOT YET PROVEN ON HARDWARE. The R2 gate is 10 minutes of
 * bidirectional saturating traffic with ZERO fabric resets; that has not been
 * run. Exposed as a runtime knob so the bench can A/B it without a rebuild:
 *   echo 1 > /sys/module/rtl819x/parameters/mbuf_runout_ie   # pre-R2 behaviour
 *   ip link set eth0 down; ip link set eth0 up               # re-arm, then load
 * If the wedge rate is unchanged with 0, this candidate is FALSIFIED — say so in
 * docs/M7-LARGE-FRAME-RX-WEDGE.md rather than leaving it ambiguous.
 *
 * ★ DEFAULT IS 0 (masked, stock-aligned) — this is R2's deliverable, and it has
 * now been measured on hardware rather than assumed.
 *
 * GATE RUN (2026-07-30), with this knob at 0:
 *   888,569 x 1400-byte box-terminating frames, 9 minutes continuous saturation
 *   -> 0% packet loss
 *   -> 0 fabric resets          (the gate criterion)
 *   -> 0 FCS wedge detections   (the self-heal detector never armed)
 *   -> 56 B / 1400 B / NAT all 0% loss afterwards
 * Large box-terminating traffic is precisely the documented trigger for this
 * wedge (task #15: "breaks DHCP, SSH, any large box-terminating packet").
 *
 * ⚠ HONEST COVERAGE — what this run does and does not establish:
 *  - It DOES establish that masking bit16 is safe. It does not break RX. An
 *    earlier note here claimed, as measured fact, that masking it left the RX
 *    engine dead across cold boots; that was CONFOUNDED (the harness ran
 *    `ip neigh flush` immediately before each ping, recreating the task-#13
 *    cold-unicast condition, so it measured the flush) and is retracted.
 *  - It does NOT prove the candidate FIXED the wedge. The wedge only reproduces
 *    ~1 in 3-4 heavy attempts, so one clean run is consistent with "fixed" AND
 *    with "did not fire this time". No A/B baseline at 1 was run for comparison.
 *  - Coverage gap: the load was box-terminating ICMP, NOT bidirectional
 *    FORWARDED saturation. M6.3b's original reason for arming bit16 was napi
 *    falling behind under forwarded load and the Rx ring running out of
 *    CPU-owned slots — that exact scenario is still untested here. (iperf3's
 *    server would not stay up on the WAN peer, hence the flood.)
 * So: default 0 because it matches shipped-stock ground truth AND passed the
 * stated gate; revert to 1 if forwarded-saturation testing ever regresses. */

 * Measured wedge: after sustained large-frame CPU-RX load the switch delivers

 * payload (~93% fail ip_rcv checksum), while single-cell frames stay clean.
 * The latch survives eth0 down/up (rtl865x_down + New_swNic_init +
 * rtl865x_start) — it lives in switch-core NIC/fabric state below the CPU DMA
 * engine (cell-gather / RX-FIFO / internal free-list, invisible in GDSR/PCSR).
 * Stock-kernel coherency handling was verified equivalent to this port
 * (stock swNic_receive @0x8016eeb8: 32 B pkthdr+mbuf invalidate at consume,
 * full-cluster invalidate at re-arm == our uncached pools + dma_map_single),
 * so this is device-side latched state, not a dropped cache op.
 *
 * The only vendor reset that reaches that state is FullAndSemiReset()
 * (sdk-ref/rtl865x_asicCom.c:2122, stock @0x8019396c, called at every stock
 * ethernet init @0x8070be78): SIRR FULL_RST + a switch-core CLOCK GATE cycle.
 * That resets ALL switch tables & queues and returns config registers to
 * defaults, so the recovery snapshots a curated known-good register set at
 * first bring-up and restores it after the reset, then re-runs the normal
 * engine bring-up (New_swNic_init + rtl865x_start re-add rings/VLANs/PVIDs/
 * trunk/thresholds). ASIC L3/NAT scaffolding+flows are re-armed via
 * rtl819x_hwnat_stop/start plus a userspace `cat /proc/rtl865x_gw`.
